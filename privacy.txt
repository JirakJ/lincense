## Overview

Accessibility Compliance Checker Pro ("the Plugin") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our JetBrains IDE plugin.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

The Plugin operates entirely locally within your JetBrains IDE and does NOT collect, transmit, or store:

- Personal identification information
- Source code or project files
- IDE settings or configurations
- Usage patterns or analytics
- Network activity or API calls
- Any telemetry or diagnostic data

### Local Data Storage

The Plugin may store configuration preferences locally on your machine to maintain plugin settings between IDE sessions. This data never leaves your computer and includes only:

- User-configured plugin settings
- Plugin state and preferences
- Cached data for performance optimization

## Data Processing

All data processing occurs locally within your development environment. The Plugin:

- Does not establish network connections
- Does not transmit data to external servers
- Does not communicate with third-party services
- Does not use cookies or tracking mechanisms

## Third-Party Services

The Plugin does not integrate with or transmit data to any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Data Security

Since all plugin operations are performed locally:

- Your data remains under your complete control
- No data transmission means no interception risk
- Your source code and projects remain private and secure

## Children's Privacy

1. Uninstalling the Plugin from your JetBrains IDE
